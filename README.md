# Data Visualization Project

### The Project
This project shows familiarity with different data visualization concepts in programming, specifically in Java.

### How was it done?
The different charts were populated using a random set of data. The data was displayed using JavaFX XYcharts. Listeners were added using the fact that XYChart data extends Node, and node can have eventlisteners.
